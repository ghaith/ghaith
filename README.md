### Welcome, browsers of the hubs!

My name is ghaith (غيث), a Sotware engineer living in Vorarlberg, Austria

I am currently working on an open source compiler for industrial automation ([RuSTy](https://github.com/PLC-lang/RuSTy))

For the curious, my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/ghaith/dotfiles) contain my vim and i3 config
